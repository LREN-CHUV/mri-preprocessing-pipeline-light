# MRI preprocesing pipeline

Pre-processing pipelines for MRI neuroimaging.

Those pipelines work on Matlab and [SPM 12](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).

They are used daily by [LREN](https://www.unil.ch/lren/en/home.html) to extract features from subjects enrolled in neuroscience research studies.

In addition, those pipelines will be deployed to hospitals participating in the [Medical Informatics platform](https://mip.humanbrainproject.eu) of the [Human Brain Project](https://humanbrainproject.eu) to process clinical MRI scans.

## Release process

This project is organised around two Git branches:

* master: for normal development of the pipelines
* deploy: for deployment of the pipelines to a Data Factory.

All commits on the deploy branch should be signed with PGP by an authorised developer.
Use

```
   git checkout deploy
   git merge --no-ff master
```

to merge code from master branch to deploy branch.
Add a signoff in file signoffs.md, then

```
  git commit -S -m "Signoff" signoffs.md
  git tag -s 1.0
```

to add a signoff and allow deployment of the pipeline to the Data Factories.
It is best practice to tag with signing the version ready for deployment with a release number.

More information about GPG and verified Git commits can be found on this [Git signing guide](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/Git_signing.html).

After release, merge the changes on deploy branch back to master branch:

```
  git checkout master
  git merge deploy
```

## Deployment

As Git signing is used, to deploy a new version of mri-preprocessing-pipeline on a target computer,
you need to:

1. For the user running the pipelines (airflow user if you use the default Data Factory settings),
   you need to create a PGP key.
2. Then for each trusted release managers of this project, you need add trust to this PGP key.

Trusted release managers are currently (31/03/2017):

* Ludovic Claude \<ludovic.claude54@googlemail.com\>, PGP key fingerprint
* Mirco Nasuti \<mirco.nasuti@chuv.ch\>, PGP key fingerprint C498B2898A53B394BECBDDDEED29A425D7F848B3
